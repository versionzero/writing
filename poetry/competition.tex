\section{Suddenly Saskatchewan}

Suddenly Saskatchewan -- the land of the living skies.

The shock of the prairies was visceral and deep. He was half way from
home: half way from his new home and half way from his old one. He
wasn't far enough to miss his old one, but he was close enough to be
nervous of his new one.

He'd opted to leave everything behind. His things were packed into a
small cube in the fringes of an old industrial park. His friends in
their homes. His former life in a bag in the first available garbage.

He carried on, not thinking to deeply about what would come along.

He was still in the prairies, but on the move. It was flatter than
Alberta, but still, it felt familiar. He came across a point of
interest. It - like most of the drive - was flat, too. Possibly the
point was that the flatness was of particular interest. He didn't know
-- there was no further information.

He carried on, zig-zagging his way northeast, towards his destination,
leaving his former life behind.

Occasionally the roads were good. However, they seemed to have grown
worse after crossing in to the new province. Some went so far as to
have no shoulder. They made him uncomfortable.

Unlike long drives in his youth, this one was draining. Both
physically and emotionally. He missed his friends and the benefits
that came with them. But not enough to go back.

He carried on, in no hurry, through the wind and a slight worry.

There were many small towns along the way. One was a paradise away
from home, or at least that's what they said it was. Who knows what
they meant by that, it seemed barren and deserted. If quiet was
paradise, then it would have been the Caribbean. Minus the people, the
beaches, and the booze.

Soon he would arrive at his destination and begin the task of making a
home. Though he was not sure what that would look like, the idea
appealed to him. This time he'd do it right. He'd get to know people
and step outside his zone of comfort. This excited him and made him
nervous at the same time.

He carried on, reflecting on his new home away from home.

He carried on, motoring through the discomfort of things left behind
and things to come.

He carried on, through the wind swept prairies that were his home.

He carried on.

\section{Time}

%Purple noises erupt.
%Cavernous caves corrupt.

The land shifts, shuffling the surface and erasing structures. Time
stops. Life is paused, but not forgotten. Matter melts and
consciousness turns over. Feelings are lost, but fear -- where it can
be seen -- runs rampant. The light dims and the dark looms, longingly
holding onto space. Stars gaze at the destruction, illuminating the
remains. Bodies rot and feed reminders of better times. Heaven holds
its share, but overflows; hell harbours the rest. We did it to
ourselves, we must remember that.

There was a time before this time that was at peace. We remember this,
but forget the why's and the how's of our present. The world lives
on. Unrelenting.

It continues to feed us, this earth that remains. But not well.

We continue to live. But not well.

Yet there is hope: glimmers in the eyes of our children. Like stars
looking up at possibilities.

We continue to live. Not with our own hope. But with that of our
future selves.

We continue to live.

\section{Harbouring Hate}

Cautiously and carefully he crept. It was critical he not be seen. His
mark, a car -- a carefully crafted and curated masterpiece of motored
magic -- sat waiting, longing for his touch. This is the part he
loved: the time before the grand exit, when anything seemed
possible. Further firing his excitement was a crowded celebration
above.

The chatter of the crowd reached down the hills, through the trees,
over the grass, meeting his ears with titillation. The chatter was
loud and proud, but meaningless. Large groups congregated and
exaggerated. It was like watching group masterbation, but without any
clear nervous hesitation. They engaged their own vanity and let loose
stinging statement shaped to shear and decisively destroy other
egos. These are the people for whom he harboured hate.

The lock came easily. The click of the bolt was orgasmic, he felt the
fear he'd found as a boy, the first time he'd started his
career. Again he crept, this time around the door and into the
seat. It welcomed him into its embrace, pulling him gracefully into
place. He savoured the moment. Perhaps he could keep it, he wondered,
briefly. But the reality of his humble and hopeless life hummed is his
head. This was not to be.

He pushed a button and the engine came to life. It purred passionately
as the exhaust poured sensually over everything in its reach. He
reveled in the moment, paralyzed with pleasure. He shifted down,
depressed the clutch. Then promptly and surely he pressed the gas. He
drove off swiftly into the night. With no hesitation, quickly towards
his final destination.

\section{Vices in Volume}

%Passing perfectly puraied poultry. Perhaps this is the pure purpose
%posed by prophets.

Creep carefully and cautiously, craft and create costumes then master
making masks to hide your person. Your person is valuable.

%Fast, and furiously find foliage for fires that burn white.

%There must be more, or less, to manage masterfully.

Music makes mountains more like vallies. Vallies make mountains more
like monuments: magnanimous, magistic and mystical.

Vultures swoop down vacuously vying for voluptuous vixens.

Vices, in volume, hurt. Praise, when possible, improves posture,
preserves and protects.

Magic make moments more meaningful than science. But science succeeds
in curing cancerous cravings, cavities and the flesh corrupted by
blades.

Time timbers and toppels all: just wait while wonder wipes worry
away. Erase the tears and extinguish fears.

People pleasers pursue pleasure purposely but imperfectly. Your peers
help provide purpose, pleasure and perspective.
