They say I have a real bad tendency to turn a good thing in to
mold. This is something that I no longer want to be told.

I want to be a good person, because you are worth keeping. I know this
true, because I love being around you, even when you are sleeping.

There is much I don't know about you, but it's clear you want
something good. I think we go well together, and I don't want my
inactions to be missunderstood.

I don't know if I am the right person, but I think we should
try. Because I don't want to loose you and wonder why.


But please, I'm still learning, so I need you to be bold. If you see
me slipping, remind me a little -- I won't be cold.

If you think I'm slipping, I need to be told. I don't want to push you
away, because I need you to hold.

If you think I'm slipping, I need to be told. This thing we have going
is too important to fold.

If you think I'm slipping, I need to be told. You are the closet thing
I've ever had to gold.


There are so many things I don't know, but I do know I want you. And
as cliche as it sounds: I hope you do too.

So if being a better person means keeping this alive. I'm ready to
take the dive. For that, I will strive.



I just need to be told. I need you to be bold: I need to be told.
