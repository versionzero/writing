You say I have a real bad tendency to turn a good thing in to mold.

This is something I no longer want to be told.

I want to be a good person, because I know you are worth the hold.

But please, I'm still learning, so I need you to be bold.

If you see me slipping, remind me a little -- I won't be cold.

If you think I'm slipping, I need to be told. I don't want to push you
away, because I need you to hold.

If you think I'm slipping, I need to be told. This thing we have going
is too important to fold.

If you think I'm slipping, I need to be told. You are the closet thing
I've ever had to gold.

If you think this is a garbage excuse for how I've been, you're
right. You don't owe me anything, but I don't need a scold.

I just need to be told. I need you to be bold: I need to be told.
